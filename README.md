## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- PostCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Intrinsic layouts
- Utopia

### What I Learned

I learned a lot about intrinsic design by studying Andy Bell's code and making some adaptations.

### Continued Development

I plan to keep learning about intrinsic design. I’m also exploring ways to adjust container sizes without relying on media queries, as I’m not fully satisfied with my current solution.
